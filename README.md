Usage
----

* CircleOfFifths just a regular `UIView` subclass with custom `CALayer` drawing with customisable `@IBInspectable` properties.  
* It can render any `Scale` type in any key of this [music theory library](https://github.com/cemolcay/MusicTheory).  
* Just set the `scale` parameter in order to change scale and/or key of circle.  
* Also draws another customisable circle below to show related major, minor and diminished chords of the scale in circle.
